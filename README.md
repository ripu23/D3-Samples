# D3-samples
The repository contains my visualisation samples as part of the course Data Visualisation.

The sample reads a csv file from javascript file and hence it won't be possible to run it without a server.
To get a server you can do either of the following:

## Xampp
1. Install [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. Place all the files in the *htdocs* folder.
3. Run the xampp server and run the files.

## Chrome extension
1. Install the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
2. Choose the cloned folder on the extension.
3. Go to the url provided by the extension and you are good to go.

## Other ways
Creating a server using Node.js or using apache server are other good options.
