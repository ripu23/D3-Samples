# D3-sample
The repository contains my visualisation sample as part of the course Data Visualisation. On successfully running the files, you will be able to see bubble charts which are completely interactive. Clicking on any bubble will display a bar chart. Further clicking on bar chart will display a pie chart.

The sample reads a csv file from javascript file and hence it won't be possible to run it without a server.
To get a server you can do either of the following:

## Xampp
1. Install [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. Place all the files in the *htdocs* folder.
3. Run the xampp server and run the files.

## Chrome extension
1. Install the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
2. Choose the cloned folder on the extension.
3. Go to the url provided by the extension and you are good to go.

## Other ways
Creating a server using Node.js or using apache server are other good options.
